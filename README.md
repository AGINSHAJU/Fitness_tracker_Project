# Fitness_tracker_Project
Your project, "Carbon & Fitness Tracker," is a web application designed to help users monitor and improve both their environmental impact and personal health. It combines two trackers into one Django-based platform:

Carbon Tracker: Tracks carbon footprint from travel, energy use, and diet, with a Google Maps visualization for travel routes.
Fitness Tracker: Monitors weight, waist size, exercise, and calories, providing a weight trend chart and health status based on BMI.
It’s user-friendly, with a front page to switch between dashboards, a points-and-badges system for engagement, and AI-driven recommendations (e.g., eco-tips, health advice). Built with Django, Tailwind CSS, Plotly for charts, and PostgreSQL, it’s a full-stack app aimed at promoting sustainability and fitness.
